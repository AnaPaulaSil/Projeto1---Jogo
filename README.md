# Projeto 1 - Quick Game

Quick is an online game inspired by the board game “Master Entertainment”. Created as a typical quiz, it has 4 niches, with different types of questions in each of them.

## Objective

Each niche consists of 10 questions and the aim is to get at least 5 of them right. After 5 hits, the game is over and can be restarted to another niche or re-enter it to check the other questions.

## Information

It is intentional not to show the correct answer to the questions, so that it will be played again.
